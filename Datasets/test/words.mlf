I
AM
VERY
TIRED
OF
SWIMMING
ABOUT
HERE
O
MOUSE
.
"*/sample2.lab"
OH
NO
JASPER
I
MUST
GO
BY
MY
VERY
OWN
SELF
.
"*/sample3.lab"
SEEING
THAT
I
AM
SO
FINE
I
MAY
AS
WELL
GO
AND
VISIT
THE
KING
.
"*/sample4.lab"
WHAT
DO
YOU
MEAN
INQUIRED
LOUIS

"*/sample5.lab"
CAN
THESE
THINGS
BE
RETURNED
DAVID
BREATHING
MORE
FREELY
AS
THE
TRUTH
BEGAN
TO
DAWN
UPON
HIM
.
"*/sample6.lab"
HE
BEGAN
A
CONFUSED
COMPLAINT
AGAINST
THE
WIZARD
WHO
HAD
VANISHED
BEHIND
THE
CURTAIN
ON
THE
LEFT
.
"*/sample7.lab"
THE
WAVES
RISE
ABOVE
OUR

.
"*/sample8.lab"
YET
THAT
TASK
WAS
NOT
SO
EASY
AS
YOU
MAY
SUPPOSE
.
"*/sample9.lab"
YES
SOMETHING
EVERYTHING
SAID

HURRIEDLY
LOOKING
FROWNINGLY

"*/sample10.lab"
THERE
IS
NO
DANGER
OF
THE
MODERN
COMMENTATORS
ON
THE
TIMAEUS
FALLING
INTO
THE
ABSURDITIES
OF
THE
NEO
PLATONISTS
.
"*/sample11.lab"
THE
ALTERNATIVE
WAS
THAT
SOMEONE
PASSING
HAD
OBSERVED
THE
KEY
IN
THE
DOOR
HAD
KNOWN
THAT
I
WAS
OUT
AND
HAD
ENTERED
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
PAPERS
.
"*/sample12.lab"
HER
REGARD
SHIFTED
TO
THE
GREEN
STALKS
AND
LEAVES
AGAIN
AND
SHE
STARTED
TO
MOVE
AWAY
.
"*/sample13.lab"
AND
SAYS
THOU
MOTHER
OF
MY
CHILDREN
I
HAVE
LOVED
THEE
AND
I
HAVE
GIVEN
THEE
A
CROWN
THAT
NONE
CAN
TAKE
AWAY
.
"*/sample14.lab"
IT
WAS
A
PAIN
TO
SEE
THEM
AND
A
SWORD
LIKE
PAIN
TO
SEE
THE
SIGNS
OF
ADOLESCENCE
THAT
MADE
REPELLENT
THEIR
PITIABLE
NAKEDNESS

"*/sample16.lab"
FORGIVE
ME
I
HARDLY
KNOW
WHAT
I
AM
SAYING
A
THOUSAND
TIMES
FORGIVE
ME
MADAME
WAS
RIGHT
QUITE
RIGHT
THIS
BRUTAL
EXILE
HAS
COMPLETELY

MY
BRAIN

"*/sample17.lab"

YOU
HAD
BETTER
TAKE
THE
LEAD
WHILE
I
WILL
PUT
ON
THE

AGAIN
AND
TRUST

"*/sample18.lab"
HE
DOESNT
SAY
EXACTLY
WHAT
IT
IS
SAID
RUTH
A
LITTLE
DUBIOUSLY

ITS
SOMETHING
ABOUT

YOU
ARE
NOW
IN

COUNTRY
IN
THE

WHERE

CAN
MAKE
A
FORTUNE
BY

EITHER

IT
RECEIVES
THE

IN

ALWAYS
READY

IT
FOR

IS
TRULY
A
CHARACTERISTIC
OF
THE
PEOPLE
HERE
AND
HOWEVER
WONDERFUL
IT
MAY
APPEAR
SILLINESS
IS
THE
DAUGHTER
OF

"*/sample25.lab"
HE
HAD
NO

WISE
ENOUGH
TO
TELL
HIM
TO
STEP
INTO
THE

CONVENTION
THEN
IN

MAKE
A
SKETCH

THROUGHOUT
THE

THE

ALMOST
BEYOND
CONJECTURE

"*/sample31.lab"
IN
THIS

IT
SHOULD
BE
MENTIONED
THAT
THE

OF
EDISON
ILLUMINATING
COMPANIES
IN
THE

YEAR
ADOPTED
RESOLUTIONS
UNANIMOUSLY
TO
THE
EFFECT
THAT
THE
EDISON
METER
WAS
ACCURATE
AND
THAT
ITS
USE
WAS
NOT
EXPENSIVE
FOR
STATIONS
ABOVE
ONE
THOUSAND
LIGHTS
AND
THAT
THE
BEST
FINANCIAL
RESULTS
WERE
INVARIABLY
SECURED
IN

THE

HAD

NOT
BEEN
PREVIOUSLY
ASSURED
OF

THE

WOULD
NEVER
HAVE
PARTED

CONSIDERABLE
A
